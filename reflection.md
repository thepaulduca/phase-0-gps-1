### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session ###

Prior to my first GPS i wasn't totally comfortable transfering local git files to github, as well as when exactly to merge

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS? ###

Most of what I was struggling with in general was cleared up for me, especially moving stuff to and from git hub. I absolutely feel more comfotable using git now. 

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? ###

We had a little trouble when we cloned from github realizing that the directory that was made was the repo and that we had to move into it, our guide cleared this up for us

### What still confuses you about Git? ###

I wouldn't say anything is confusing but I just dont feel like i could use it very fluidly quite yet - i need to think about it or look it up to remeber what exactly command to use - if i had to pick one thing that confuses me I guess it would be when to merge with which branch to merge with

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? ###

Really enjoyed it! I found it both exciting and rewarding, it was great to work with another person and helping each other taught me a lot. I look foward to future pairing, I think its a great way to really test and develop the skills we are learning.
